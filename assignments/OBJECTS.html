    <p>There are four instantiation patterns in JavaScript. They are:
        <ul>
            <li>Functional</li>
            <li>Functional-shared</li>
            <li>Prototypal</li>
            <li>Pseudoclassical</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Functional</h3>
    <p>With functional instantiation, we first create a function.
        Inside the function we create an empty object and add
        properties and methods to it. We then return this object.
        Every time the function is called we will have access to
        the methods that were created.</p>
        
    <p>Pros:
        For most people that are learning JavaScript this is the method that they learned for 
        creating a new object.For anybody reading your code, it is easy to understand because 
        all the functions are contained within the object. The properties are private since 
        they are contained within the closure scope.

        Cons:
        Since all the methods are contained within the function, if you create a second instance 
        of that object, you will have duplicated all the properties and methods in memory. If 
        you create a new object using this method, then change any of the methods and create a 
        new instance, the two objects will be referencing different methods.</p>
